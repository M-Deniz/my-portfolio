        In my early years, around the age of 5 or 6, I stumbled upon a discarded Commodore 64, accompanied by a handwritten booklet. Intriguing alien-like scripts filled its pages, resembling hieroglyphs. These, I soon discovered, were commands necessary for playing games on the system. The catch? No dedicated internal storage meant entering these commands each timeâ€”a unique introduction to computing constraints.

        Subsequently, I resourcefully acquired a PlayStation 2 from discarded items, driven by my desire to engage with more contemporary games. Given my father's disapproval of such pastimes, obtaining the gaming console required a somewhat unconventional approach. Over the course of one to two years, I immersed myself in titles such as God of War, Metal Gear Solid, and Dirt Rally, thereby expanding my gaming repertoire.

        During that period, my affinity for video games deepened. At the age of 7, my father provided me with an HP PC, akin to a spacecraft with 4 GB of RAM, an Intel Duo Core CPU, and a 500 GB HDD. While modest by today's standards, these specifications proved more than sufficient for my needs in 2007, shaping my early technological experiences.

        In 2014, as games became more demanding my existing HP PC fell short. Determined to broaden my gaming experience within budget, I configured a new system with an Intel Core i7 4770k, GTX 980, 16 GB of RAM, and a terabyte HDD. This upgrade not only facilitated the play of newer titles but also sparked a heightened curiosity for computational capabilities.
